## Arnaud Grignard

I am a computer scientist specializing in complex systems modeling and information visualization. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from l'universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie-UPMC. He is now a research scientist in the [City Science](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/city-science/overview/) research group at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). While working on different fields of application such as multi-level, urban systems and human mobility, I develop a new approach called agent-based visualization to handle real-time visualization tasks applied both to data and simulation outputs. Since 2011, I am one of the main developers of the GAMA Platform, a modeling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit, agent-based simulations.
